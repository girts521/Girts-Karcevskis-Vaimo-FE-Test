Technologies used:
- React
- React create app
- React router
- Redux
- reduxjs/toolkit
- Sass
- Typescript

I choose to use React because Iam the most comfoirtable working in React and it makes it very easy to create applications like this. 
Also, i love that it is very modular and i can add the libraries and features I need/want. 

In order to create the project very fast i used create react app. It instantly creates a project where you can just start writting the code without the need to configure everything first. 

React router is not really needed for this project, because there is only one page. But I added it so that if later it would become a bigger project it would be easy to add more pages. 

I choose to use Redux for global state management, mainly because i feel the most comfortable using it, and considering the time constraints, I did not want to try something new. But in the future in a project with more time, I would try to use Recoil. I have not yet used Recoil, but I have looked at how it works and is sounds very interesting, that why i really want to try and use it. 

Redux toolkit is something i always use togeather with redux, because it simplifies the use of redux greatly. 

I enjoy sass over styled components. Mostly because I like sass syntax more, as well as the use of classes instead of components. 

I try to use Typescript for all of my projects. But often it makes the development a little bit slower, because I have to write all the types. But after carefully writting all the types it makes development much more predictable. In this project due to time constraints at later places i have used "any" as a type, to save time and work on more features. 

There are a few mistakes in this project, due to time constraints. Mainly in the Quantity component, when the quantity is changed via the input not the buttons.  


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
