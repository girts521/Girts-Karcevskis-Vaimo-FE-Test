//strict mode was causing issues with api being called twice - data changing with each call - the number of images not rerendering and showing incorrect,
//if running in dev mode then this can cause data displayed wrong, but in production even with strict mode it should not be an issue. (in production it should render only once with strict mode on)

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
